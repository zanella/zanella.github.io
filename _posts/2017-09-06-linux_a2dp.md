I listen to music through Spotify, and since it has a [linux client](https://www.spotify.com/br/download/linux/) all the better, if not for the minor problem that it tends to use ~1GB of RAM, yeah... it's supposed to play music not compete w/ Chrome, so I tried to use my Android as an audio source: it works! if fucking works!!!

So, how? [A2DP](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Bluetooth/#index2h2)

 - pair your cellphone using bluetooth
 - hit play on whatever media player you use on your cellphone
 - great success
 
The WiFi (`lshw -class network` -> driver=ath10k_pci) got flaky as fuck, so while using it I'm also using the USB tethered connection (which also works!!!)

Now the only thing missing is adding the MediaPlaying info and the MediaButtons to whatever is responsible for it in Ubuntu and being able to change musics using the keyboard...

On Ubuntu 17.04 using `systemctl status bluetooth.service` yields the whole path to my paired cellphone, so, using the info from the link above:
`dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0/dev_84_10_0D_EC_05_C8 org.bluez.MediaControl1.Next` - [API](https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez/+/5.5/doc/media-api.txt)

So "binding" a listener to the media keys when an A2DP device is connected should do it...
