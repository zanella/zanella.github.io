I recently bought a [USB-C to ethernet dongle](https://www.worten.pt/produtos/hub-mitsai-usb-c-3-usb-3-0-1-rj45-preto-6897009)

The chipset it has is a Realtek 8153.

My router sits far from the room I work (the work room has a somewhat big metal thing in it,
 makes the Wi-Fi signal jump up and down), the cable length from router <-> room is around 35 meters.

After passing the cable (cat 6) and testing it -> failure, no idea why, time to scour the internet...

[This post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254657436?sortBy=rank) describes exactly what I experienced.

One of the many posts I read commented on how the power could be the issue, so I decided to then plug the USB dongle 
 to the Wi-Fi repeater -> works

The cable to the Wi-Fi repeater is around 14 meters.

So: the cable length was the culprit, empirically proven.
