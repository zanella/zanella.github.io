Spotify sucks:
 - The linux desktop client uses more than 2GB of RAM;
 - The web client is shit (checking before adding duplicates? no, radio? no)
 - Your list of liked songs drops some songs from time to time;
 - If you carefully craft a playlist for a trip where you're going to be offline for a while make sure you don't forget to get it online at some point or it will just wipe the fucking downloaded songs clean with no warning whatsoever
 
 But, the worst of all: "radio" is a 10-ish list of songs, like, wtf!? of all the hard problems that come handling huge amounts of data, randomly generating a list is just not one of them!
 
 The 10k limit on liked songs + the shitty radio makes spotify really good at overfitting, eclecticism? nah, fuck that.
 
 How can Spotify's squad-tribe-guild "success" be so praised when it does such a sloppy job?
 
 p.s. Either Spotify holds free speech very dearly or doesn't give a fuck about the forums, since there's no staff reply... seems to be the latter: [spotify competitors](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/Make-the-switch-Spotify-competitors/td-p/29701)
