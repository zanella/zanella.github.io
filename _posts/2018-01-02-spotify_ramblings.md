Spotify rant:
 - The linux desktop client uses more than 1GB of RAM (*very* close to 2);
 - The web client is buggy (checking before adding duplicates? no, radio? no)
 - Your list of liked songs drops some songs from time to time;
 - If you carefully craft a playlist for a trip where you're going to be offline for a while make sure you don't forget to get it online at some point or it will just wipe the downloaded songs clean with no warning whatsoever
 
 But, the worst of all: "radio" is a 10-ish list of songs, like, wtf!? of all the hard problems that come handling huge amounts of data, randomly generating a list is just not one of them!
 
 The 10k limit on liked songs + the "radio" makes spotify really good at overfitting... serendipity, eclecticism? Ain't Nobody Got Time for That!
 
 How can Spotify's squad-tribe-guild "success" be so praised when it does such a sloppy job?
 
 p.s. Either Spotify holds free speech very dearly or no employee reads the forums, since there's no staff reply... seems to be the latter: [spotify competitors](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/Make-the-switch-Spotify-competitors/td-p/29701)
