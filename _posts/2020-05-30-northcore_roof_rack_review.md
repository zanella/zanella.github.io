Northcore soft roof rack review

keywords: northcore soft roof rack review Double Overhead bad sucks

Should you buy it? NO!

So, first trip with my Northcore Double Overhead soft roof rack, I strap everything as tight as I can,
I didn't realize it then but I had already seen the major problem with it:

* There's no *GOOD* buckle for the nylon strap, what do I mean by that:
you know those "d-rings" that you have on your backpack? or those on "army" belts? They provide more
friction and strangle the straps, so it doesn't just slip off, well, there's no such thing on this crappy product.

The strap system consists of a single shitty buckle (photo here) that has no grip whatsoever on the strap...

First trip with it, I hit 80km/h, my board goes flying, I brake, it comes back down.
I didn't know it then but now my board has a hole (photo here)

I hastily park on the side of the road, me and my girlfriend come out to see the damage, *luckily* the 
back strap didn't go loose all the way, but, now my board bag has a hole as well <img src="{{site.url}}/media/ripped_surf_bag.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

So..., yeah, it's quite shitty, don't buy it.

Btw, sure, you may say: "well, you shouldn't have gone faster than 70km/h", valid point, but see:

I'm not saying "well, the rack struggled a bit and then gave up", no no no, the strap that stays inside the car went the fuck away, instantly!
